# Communication

## Group Rules

- Programming can be hard and frustrating but we never give up!
- Everyone tries to meet everyday at 8pm to discuss what to do.
- It is ok not to attend the daily meeting as long as we keep in touch and know
  what to do.
- We work indivudualy in our free time on issues we created during the meetings.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
